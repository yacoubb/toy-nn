# toy-nn

A toy neural network library written entirely in numpy and aimed at being as readable as possible.

The maths and functions are based off formulas found in the free online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com). If you're totally new to deep learning and intend to use this repository to learn more about the underlying math behind it I would recommend giving chapters 1 and 2 a read.
